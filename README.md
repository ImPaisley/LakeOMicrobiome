# LakeOMicrobiome

This R script includes taxonomic, diversity, and other statistical analyses performed on Illumina MiSeq 16S sequencing data.
The primary goal of these analyses were to characterize the dominant taxa the make up the bacterial community of Lake Okeechobee using 16S data.

Charts created include boxplots, scatterplots, stacked bar charts, nMDS plots, CCA plots, line plots, and any combinations.

Files provided are:
- Batch corrected ASV count table (which excludes any ASVs found in the blank controls, the blank control samples, any samples with a 
sequencing read count less than 10,000 reads, any mitchondrial ASVs, and any chloroplast ASVs)
- NOT batch corrected ASV count table
- Taxonomy table
- Metadata table
*** The rest of the files included were created within the R script ***

Comments either describe what is happening in the line of code or presents the result of the code
